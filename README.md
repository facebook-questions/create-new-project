# make-new-project
CLI tool to help me generate a template project so I can modify to help answer a question 🎉

What should happen ?
    ❌ Ask for the project's name
    ❌ Make a new directory based on the given name
    ❌ Ask for the project's type (html, html + css, html + css + js)
    ❌ Write necessary files with template code inside the new directory
