# make-new-project
CLI tool to help me generate a template project so I can modify to help answer a question 🎉

    ✅ Ask for the project's name  
    ✅ Make a new directory based on the given name  
    ✅ Ask for the project's type (html, html + css, html + css + js)  
    ✅ Write necessary files with template code inside the new directory
